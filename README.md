# Global reservoir and river fish yield
*Reidy Liermann C., McIntyre P.B., Grill. G., Fluet-Chouinard E., Lehner B. In preparation. Global net losses of inland fisheries due to large dams*

## Scripts to:
- Map riverine fisheries (update to McIntyre et al. 2016 - PNAS)
- Estimate reservoir catch for 30k reservoirs from Global Dam Watch database
- Estimate per-reservoir fish yield loss from damming
- Estimate yield from downstream flow regulation
